Learn production-proof Terraform & AWS EKS Best Practices using Handson concepts and labs 


☆Please check preview videos to see if this course is really for you☆



Are you one of the below?

You learned Terraform basics but don't know how to write Terraform code for production-ready AWS infra

You don't know how to use Terraform Remote Modules for VPC, IAM, Security Group, EKS, etc

You learned AWS EKS best practices using EKSCTL CLI but now you want to apply them using Terraform

You want to create AWS EKS using Terraform, and want to be able to give right permissions to AWS IAM identities in K8s cluster using ClusterRoleBinding (RBAC: Role Based Access Control)

You don't know how to configure pod-level AWS IAM authentication (IRSA: IAM Role for Service Account) using Terraform

You want to setup Cluster Autoscaler in Terraform

You want to auto-mount EFS to EKS worker nodes using userdata script



Who should take this course

you have intermediate knowledge of AWS (EC2, VPC, subnet, load balancer, IAM, EKS, S3, SSM, KMS, etc)

you have learned EKS best practices

you have learned Terraform basics

you want to deploy AWS and EKS for production

you want to learn DevOps IaC best practices

you want to level up your DevOps game to senior level, and get promotion, raise, or switch jobs



who should NOT need to take this course

you don't plan to deploy AWS EKS using Terraform

you haven't learned AWS EKS best pracitces (in my other course "AWS EKS Handson")

you haven't learned Terraform basics (in my other course "Terraform Masterclass (v0.14")




Terraform & EKS knowledge and skills you will acquire from this course will put you on a fast-tracked path to a senior level DevOps.

With these handson skills, you can make real and immediate impacts to your work. It's only a matter of time before you can discuss your next promotion and raise with your manager!




5 Reasons why you should take this course:

1. Instructed by a cloud DevOps engineer (with CKA and certified AWS DevOps pro) working at US company in SF

I have been pretty handson with Kubernetes, AWS, and AWS EKS. With 6.5+ industry experience in both North America and Europe, I breakdown and explain hard concepts using diagrams


2. Practical, Scalable, and Extensible Terraform Design Pattern that abstracts and modularzises resources well

It is not enough to take some basic Terraform courses to build production-ready cloud infrastructures.

Most courses don't teach you how to make Terraform code scalable, actually they don't even mention it.

The standard software design principles still apply to Terraform and I will cover one of those in this course (i.e. Facade pattern), so that you can build clean, scalable, managable, and extensible terraform code.


3. Production-ready best practices of EKS (security, IRSA, CA, EFS, Logging etc)

In this course, we are going in parallel with my other course "AWS EKS Handson" when it comes to EKS best practices.

We will cover:
- encrypting K8s secrets and EBS volumes
- AWS identity authentication & authorization into K8s cluster
- adding taints and labels to K8s worker nodes from Terraform
- enabling master node's logging
- pod-level AWS IAM role (IRSA)
- Cluster Autoscaler
- customizing EKS worker node's userdata script to auto-mount EFS
all using terraform code.


4. Level up your DevOps game to Senior level and get promoted & raise
Terraform & EKS knowledge and skills you will acquire from this course will put you on a fast-tracked path to a senior level DevOps.

With these handson skills, you can make real and immediate impacts to your work. It's only a matter of time before you can discuss your next promotion and raise with your manager!



5. Entire course under SIX HOURS

I tried to make this course compact and concise so students can learn the concepts and handson skills in shorted amount of time, because I know a life of software engineer is already pretty busy :)
