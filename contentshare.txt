Hi Suchit,

Thank you for your response.

Please find below the details and justification for the requested /24 CIDR VPC in the Chain Loop Non-Prod account (471112531675):

‚∏ª

üîß Infrastructure Plan

This VPC is intended to host Azure DevOps build agents, which can be provisioned as either:
	‚Ä¢	EC2 instances, or
	‚Ä¢	EKS pods (Kubernetes-based ephemeral agents)

The current /21 shared VPC is oversized for this workload and already accommodates other applications like the supply chain cluster, so we are requesting a clean and isolated /24 block for agent use.

‚∏ª

üìä CIDR Justification
	‚Ä¢	The build agents are expected to scale to 100 parallel jobs, which aligns with the on-prem Azure DevOps capacity.
	‚Ä¢	We plan to use t3.medium (AMD) instances as worker nodes, which support up to 12 pods per node with 2 ENIs.
	‚Ä¢	A team scaling to 100 pods could require 10+ EC2 nodes, each reserving 15‚Äì20 IPs ‚Äî which would easily exhaust a /25 subnet (128 IPs).
	‚Ä¢	Hence, we propose a /24 CIDR (256 IPs) to be split into two /25 subnets for better control and IP headroom.
	‚Ä¢	This design follows the CoE recommendation for addressing IPv4 exhaustion in EKS clusters using custom networking.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ CoE Policy Alignment
	‚Ä¢	Region: Mumbai (ap-south-1) as per standard
	‚Ä¢	Instance Type: t3.medium (AMD) ‚Äî CoE approved, no Graviton or Intel
	‚Ä¢	No public IPs will be assigned
	‚Ä¢	SSM: Not enabled ‚Äî we will use ARCOS or PAM for access
	‚Ä¢	AMI: Will be selected from CoE-approved AMIs
	‚Ä¢	Disk: Will use only gp3 volumes
	‚Ä¢	Private NAT Gateway: Will be used for outbound internet access from private subnets
	‚Ä¢	VACA agent (twistlock-defender): Will be run alongside agent workloads as required

‚∏ª

üè∑Ô∏è Tagging and Budget Code
	‚Ä¢	App ID: APP12345
	‚Ä¢	Budget Code: BU123-DEVOPS-AGENTS

We‚Äôll ensure that Terraform provisioning follows CoE-approved modules and tagging standards.
